### Description

For this assignment, I had to wire and code an LED to blink on and off at a set rate.

### Code

LED Blink Revisited
Blinks an LED at a set rate.
*/

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(7, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(7, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(7, LOW);
  delay(500);
}
